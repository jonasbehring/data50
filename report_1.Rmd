This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Intro. *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
professors <- read.csv("~/Documents/data_course/projects/professors.csv")
students <- read.csv("~/Documents/data_course/projects/students.csv")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
